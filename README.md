This repository contains the Bookdown files of the R-Lernplattform. Please note that the repository itself is private and will not be published.
Only the website will be public once github pages is activated.

## Todo

- [ ] establish workflow for adding new topics
- [ ] replace all links
- [ ] check all pages (compare to exsiting web page)
- [ ] find better way to handle dependencies. Currently all required packages are loaded when the project is built. This is not a good idea
functions of different packages may have the same name.
